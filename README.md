# Nimbulite
An automated SOAR solution for AWS, designed to model and remediate GuardDuty findings in real-time.

## ⚠️ Project Status: Pre-Alpha
Nimbulite is in the early stages of design and is under active development.

The core framework, configuration models, and initial set of remediation playbooks are currently being built. While the vision is clear and the foundation is being laid, the project is not yet ready for production use. We welcome contributors who are excited to help shape the future of this tool from the ground up!

## About Nimbulite
Cloud security alerts are constant. Responding to every GuardDuty finding manually is a slow, error-prone process that consumes valuable engineering time.

Nimbulite is being built to act as an autonomous security engineer for your AWS environment. It listens for GuardDuty events and automatically executes pre-defined, community-vetted remediation playbooks. Its goal is to immediately contain threats, preserve evidence for forensic analysis, and notify your team of the actions taken, allowing your security personnel to focus on root cause analysis instead of reactive firefighting.

## Key Features (Vision)
- **Declarative Playbooks**: Define complex remediation logic for any GuardDuty finding in simple, human-readable YAML files.
- **Event-Driven & Serverless**: Built to run on AWS Lambda for a scalable, cost-effective, and maintenance-free architecture.
- **Highly Configurable**: Granular control to enable/disable findings, playbooks, and even individual remediation steps to match your organization's risk tolerance.
- **Safety First**: Designed with safeguards and clear logging to ensure you always know what actions are being taken in your environment.
